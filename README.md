# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript

- This project is to help future bootcamp students study with ease and efficiency.
- This application was built to ease the stress off of bootcamp students who are learning new things at such a fast-paced and helps them have information on each subject that is easy to read and organized.
- This solves getting overwhelmed by so much information coming at them at once and being able to choose what subject they want to study first with every note organized by bullet points.
- I learn how to navigate Terminal, how to link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to make an appealing and interactive application. I learned how to push/pull my changes to the Git Hub and how to navigate the Git Hub website.
